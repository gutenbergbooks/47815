<h2 class="main">PREFACE</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">At the close of the Spanish-American War in 1898,
Spain withdrew from the Philippine Islands after more than three
centuries of residence, and turned over the responsibilities of
Philippine control to the people of the United States.</p>
<p class="par">A number of years have elapsed since the American people
took up the white man&rsquo;s burden in the Orient, and although
thousands of Americans have visited our new possessions during this
time, there are still many persons who think vaguely of the Philippines
as a tiny group of islands somewhere in the Pacific, inhabited by half
savage people who wear little or no clothing and prefer dog meat to all
other kinds of food.</p>
<p class="par">When one stops to note that the archipelago consists of
more than three thousand islands, which, if placed within the United
States, would occupy an area extending from Minneapolis to New Orleans
and from Denver <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e169" href=
"#xd21e169" name="xd21e169">vi</a>]</span>to Kansas City, he secures a
more definite idea of their magnitude. And when he learns further that
the soil of these islands is astonishingly fertile, that they abound in
valuable timber, coal, gold, copper, iron, lead, and platinum, and that
of the eight million inhabitants, only about half a million are
uncivilized, the remainder being Christians, some of whom are highly
educated, with all the graces and accomplishments of a European, he
again finds himself startled at the importance of these new American
territories across the seas.</p>
<p class="par">It was with the idea of giving American boys and girls a
clearer idea of the Filipino people,&mdash;how they live, what they eat
and wear, how they work and how they play,&mdash;that this little book
was written. The author recalls with the greatest pleasure the two
years spent among the school boys and girls of Albay Province, and is
glad to number among his warmest friends the Filipinos of southern
Luzon.</p>

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER I</h2>
<h2 class="main">FRANCISCO&rsquo;S HOME</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Francisco was a Filipino boy who lived in the
southern part of the island of Luzon between the towns of Albay
(&Auml;l&prime;-b&#563;) and Camalig (Ca&#775;-m&auml;&prime;-lig). If
you will look at a map of the Philippine Islands, you can find these
places. His home was on a large tract of land where his father raised
rice for the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb2" href="#pb2" name=
"pb2">2</a>]</span>use of the family, and abaca
(&auml;&prime;-b&auml;-c&auml;), or Manila hemp, for the market. Back
of their house was a grove of tall coconut trees. From the nuts which
grew on these trees they made a part of their living, and their hemp
crop was also of much value.</p>
<p class="par">Francisco had one sister and two brothers, all older
than himself. Pablo (P&auml;b&prime;-l&#333;), the oldest brother, was
studying in the College of Santo Tomas (S&auml;n&prime;-t&#333;
T&#333;-m&auml;s&prime;) in Manila, preparing to be a priest, while
Jos&eacute; (H&#333;-s&#257;&prime;) and Maria
(Ma&#775;-re&#862;e&prime;-&auml;), the sister, were living at home and
attending school.</p>
<p class="par">This home was very interesting and quite different from
the houses in which American boys and girls live. The house was made
almost entirely of bamboo,&mdash;bamboo walls, floors, ceilings, and
rafters. The roof consisted of the leaves of the nipa (<span class=
"corr" id="xd21e311" title=
"Source: ne&#862;epa">ne&#862;e&prime;-pa</span>) palm, sewed together
to form shingles and tied to the rafters with strips of very strong
rattan.</p>
<p class="par">Filipinos always build their houses well up from the
ground so as to be above the dampness. Francisco&rsquo;s father had put
their <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb3" href="#pb3" name=
"pb3">3</a>]</span>home on bamboo poles about six feet high. This made
a large room underneath the house where were kept three pigs, a horse,
and their little two-wheeled cart called a carromata
(c&#259;r-r&#333;-m&auml;&prime;-t&auml;). Francisco&rsquo;s mother
found bamboo floors convenient, because very little sweeping was
necessary; crumbs and waste from the kitchen were dropped between the
strips of bamboo to the ground below, and there the pigs and chickens
quickly ate them.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e318width"><img src="images/p018.jpg" alt=

<p class="figureHead"><span class="sc">Camalig</span></p>

<div class="figure xd21e325width"><img src="images/p019.jpg" alt=
"Filipino House" width="619" height="529">
<p class="figureHead"><span class="sc">Filipino House</span></p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">In the front part of the house was a large room called a
sala (s&auml;&prime;-l&auml;), and here the family sat when their
friends came to see them. There were a number of bamboo chairs and a
table in this sala; large windows let in the light and air, and offered
a view of the blue Pacific and the great Mayon (My-&#333;n&prime;)
Volcano which lifted its head high among the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb5" href="#pb5" name="pb5">5</a>]</span>clouds a few
miles to the northward. These windows were not made of glass, however,
but of small shells about three inches square, fitted into wooden
frames that slid back and forth along the sill.</p>
<p class="par">The floor of the sala was not bamboo. It was made of a
beautiful hard wood of a dark red color, and was kept very smooth by
polishing it with banana leaves; this was Francisco&rsquo;s work, and
he took much pride in it. Very often when friends came in for a visit,
the table and chairs were pushed back against the wall, Jos&eacute;
brought out his musical instrument that looked like a guitar but
sounded like a mandolin, and all would join in a dance.</p>
<p class="par">The house contained several sleeping rooms with bamboo
beds. Francisco preferred to sleep on the floor wrapped in a petate
(pe-t&auml;&prime;-te), or grass mat. The beds were very simply made
with bamboo legs and a bottom of woven rattan much like a cane-seated
chair. Jos&eacute; had learned at school that mosquito bites cause
fever, and therefore he had arranged his own bed to be covered with
mosquito <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb6" href="#pb6" name=
"pb6">6</a>]</span>netting; but the others of the family slept as
Francisco did, completely wrapped in their petates.</p>

"Making Bamboo Beds" width="623" height="679">
<p class="figureHead"><span class="sc">Making Bamboo Beds</span></p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">The kitchen was a very different sort of place from
those in American homes. The <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb7" href=
"#pb7" name="pb7">7</a>]</span>stove was a large square platform about
four feet high, covered with soil packed down till it was almost as
hard as rock, and having on it several stones. When Francisco&rsquo;s
mother wished to cook rice or boil a chicken, she made a little fire on
this platform, drew two or three of the stones near it, and placed the
pot or kettle on them and over the flames. Filipino houses never have
chimneys, but the smoke finds its way out through the cracks in the
bamboo walls. The wood used for cooking is usually cut into small
sticks an inch or so in diameter and twelve or fifteen inches long,
and, fortunately, burns with very little smoke.</p>
<p class="par">Adjoining the kitchen was a small square room containing
nothing but a large tin can with several small holes in the bottom, and
a long rope passing over one of the bamboo rafters. When Francisco
wished to take a bath, he filled this can with water, pulled it up over
his head, and fastened the rope so that he could stand under the
shower. The water ran on down through the bamboo floor <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8" name="pb8">8</a>]</span>to the
ground below, making a cool, damp place for the pigs to lie.</p>
<p class="par">Filipinos enjoy frequent baths because the hot climate
of their country makes bathing a necessity. Jos&eacute; would get home
from school each morning about half past ten, take a cool bath and lie
down for a siesta (s&#301;-&#277;s&prime;-t&auml;), or nap, during the
hot noontime, for school did not begin again until half past two; then
he would go back feeling refreshed and ready for an afternoon of hard
study.</p>
<p class="par">The siesta habit is a very general one in the
Philippines. For an hour or more before and after noon, shops are
closed, business stops, and the streets are deserted, while behind
drawn shutters, the people are peacefully sleeping after their midday
meal. About two o&rsquo;clock, they take up their regular duties again,
thoroughly rested from the morning&rsquo;s exertions and the extreme
heat of noontime. The custom is almost a necessity in tropical
countries, and would undoubtedly be a valuable habit for the busy,
hurrying American to practice, if he could only feel that the time
could be spared for it. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9"

<h2 class="main">FRANCISCO&rsquo;S WORK</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Until Francisco was old enough to go to school, he
spent a great deal of time in helping his mother about the house,
carrying water, going to the market for bananas and fish, or polishing
the shiny floor of the sala. His mother was very neat and did not like
to have the ground about their home littered with leaves or sticks. So,
every few days, some one of the family would sweep carefully all around
the house, using a broom made of strips of stiff rattan about two feet
long fastened tightly at one end but loose at the other.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e366width"><img src="images/p025.jpg" alt=
"Boys carrying Water" width="572" height="617">
<p class="figureHead"><span class="sc">Boys carrying Water</span></p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">It was Francisco&rsquo;s morning duty to carry water
from the creek to the house so that his mother would have plenty for
cooking. If you had watched him at this task you might have seen him
carrying a long bamboo <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href="#pb10"
name="pb10">10</a>]</span>pole on his shoulder. This he filled with
water and brought back to the kitchen where he stood it up on end in a
corner. When anyone wanted water, the bamboo pole was tilted to let it
run out, and if you had asked Francisco for a drink while he was
carrying <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href="#pb11" name=
"pb11">11</a>]</span>it to the house, he would have told you to put
your mouth to the edge of his bucket and drink all you wanted.
Filipinos can drink very easily in this way, but you would probably
have poured most of the water on your clothes.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e377width"><img src="images/p026.jpg" alt=
"Women Washing" width="621" height="542">
<p class="figureHead"><span class="sc">Women Washing</span></p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">The creek, where they got their drinking water, also
supplied the water for washing <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb12"
href="#pb12" name="pb12">12</a>]</span>their clothes. Once each week
Francisco&rsquo;s mother and Maria would wade out into the water with
the clothes they wished to wash. These they scrubbed thoroughly in the
running stream, and then laying them on stones, they would beat them
with paddles to get all the dirt out of the cloth. This proved to be a
very simple way to take a bath at the same time that the clothes were
being washed. The garments were hung upon bushes or spread on the grass
to dry before being ironed. Filipino women sit on the floor while
ironing their clothes, and, instead of using a board, they spread a mat
or blanket in front of them and iron on this.</p>
<p class="par">Francisco liked to go to the market because there were
so many interesting things to see and hear. Just back of the public
school was a large open square and there, every evening, the market was
held. Long before sundown you could see the people coming with great
baskets of fish on their heads, with strings of bananas, with camotes
(c&#259;-m&#333;&prime;-tes), or sweet potatoes, tomatoes, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="#pb13" name="pb13">13</a>]</span>onions,
corn, mangoes, little green lemons about as large as plums, and many
other vegetables and fruits, which they spread on the ground to show to
the best advantage.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e390width"><img src="images/p028.jpg" alt=
"Market Place" width="623" height="647">
<p class="figureHead"><span class="sc">Market Place</span></p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">Every night the market place was filled with people
examining the articles to be <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href=
"#pb14" name="pb14">14</a>]</span>sold and quarreling over the price,
or standing in little groups for conversation. Dogs, lean and hungry,
ran here and there watching a chance to steal a fish and dash out into
the darkness to devour it. The air was thick with the mixed odors of
fish, onions, and smoke from the many little coal oil torches which
lighted each group of wares. The Babel of sounds was almost
deafening,&mdash;conversations in the native dialect, in Spanish, in
Chinese, and in English, an uproar from yelling boys and an occasional
yelp as some dog was detected in the act of securing his supper without
paying for it.</p>
<p class="par">Francisco was of much help to his father, also, in
taking care of the carabao (c&#259;&prime;-ra-b&auml;&#333;), or water
buffaloes. These are large, strong animals that are used by the
Filipinos for plowing the fields, for hauling the rice and hemp to
market, and sometimes for riding,&mdash;although the rider must not be
in a hurry, because they move very slowly.</p>
<p class="par">Carabao have a strange habit of wanting to lie down in
the mud and water for several hours <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15"
href="#pb15" name="pb15">15</a>]</span>each day. If their master does
not allow this, but tries to make them work all day, they sometimes
become crazed and do much damage, even killing people or severely
hurting them.</p>

<p class="figureHead"><span class="sc">Plowing</span></p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">Francisco drove his father&rsquo;s carabao out to the
pasture every day, where they ate the fresh green grass awhile. Later,
they buried themselves up to their necks in the muddy water, to lie
happy and contented until they were forced to come out again to graze
and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href="#pb16" name=
"pb16">16</a>]</span>be driven home. Each carabao had a strand of
twisted rattan through its nose, and by means of a cord fastened to
this, it could be led and driven very easily. Filipinos often pull very
hard upon these cords, and many carabao have their noses badly torn by
careless or cruel drivers. When well treated, however, they are
valuable and necessary beasts of burden, strong, patient, and able to
endure heavy work in a hot climate.</p>

<h2 class="main">RICE</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Francisco used to go with his father and uncles to
the rice fields, where he would watch the carabao while the men worked.
A great deal of hard labor is necessary to raise a crop of rice. First,
the seed must be sown in a plot of ground called a seed bed, where it
is left alone for five or six weeks until the plants have grown several
inches high. During this time the men are busy plowing the field and
getting the ground ready for the second planting. This is a very hard
and disagreeable task, because the work has to be done in mud and
water, the men sometimes wading up to their knees in the slimy black
mud while guiding the plow.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e427width"><img src="images/p033.jpg" alt=
"Rice Paddies" width="623" height="605">
<p class="figureHead"><span class="sc">Rice Paddies</span></p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">When the ground has been thoroughly stirred and is well
under water, the young plants are taken out of the seed bed, cut back
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18" name=
"pb18">18</a>]</span>a few inches, and replanted in the field. This is
also very tiresome work, for each rice plant must be thrust into the
soft mud by hand. Men, women, and children come out for this part of
the planting, roll up their clothes beyond the reach of mud or water,
and, with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name=
"pb19">19</a>]</span>backs bent low, move slowly across the fields,
setting out the young rice plants.</p>
<p class="par">Rice grows well only when it is kept flooded, and this
is done by means of ditches that lead from near-by streams. Great
pieces of sod are thrown up in long rows, forming a sort of dike that
holds the water and separates the fields into divisions called paddies.
These long strips of sod are used as a pathway by persons who need to
cross the fields and wish to remain dry.</p>
<p class="par">Before many days, the young plants are growing, tall and
green, and the field makes a beautiful appearance as the wind sweeps
across it. In about five or six months the green has turned to a rich
yellow; the rice is then ripe and ready for the harvest. Again the men,
women, and children go out to the fields armed with sickles to gather
in the precious crop. Again they move slowly across the level
ground,&mdash;dry now,&mdash;with backs bent low, gathering in the
grain that is to furnish them food for months to come. The rice bundles
are piled on carts, the carabao <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb21"
href="#pb21" name="pb21">21</a>]</span>strain at their yokes, and the
loads go off to the house to be carefully stored away, for use when
needed.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e444width"><img src="images/p035.jpg" alt=
"Rice Field" width="493" height="720">
<p class="figureHead"><span class="sc">Rice Field</span></p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">When Francisco&rsquo;s mother wanted rice for cooking,
she went down the bamboo steps, unfastened the door that led to the
store-room under the house, and, taking several bundles into the yard,
she laid them on a petate spread on the ground. Then, stepping out of
her chinelas (ch&#301;-ne&#817;&prime;-l&auml;s&#798;), or slippers,
she trod upon the heads of grain until she had separated the rice from
the stalk. The next thing needed was to get rid of the chaff. To do
this, she put several handfuls of the grains into a flat tray, and, by
carefully throwing the seeds into the air and catching them again in
the tray, the chaff was blown away, leaving the clean, fresh rice
grains all ready for cooking. Another way to do this is by pounding the
rice in a wooden mortar until the seed is well separated from the
hulls. Sometimes rice flour is made in these mortars, and bread is
baked; but the most common way of cooking is by boiling. <span class=

really complete without it. They like it boiled very dry, and a large
plate of it is always placed beside one&rsquo;s regular plate to be
eaten with the meal, much as we eat bread. It is interesting to know
that so much rice <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23"

quantities must be shipped in from China in addition to what is raised
by the Filipinos themselves.</p>
<p class="par">The most commonly raised rice is almost pure white, but
there is one variety grown in certain parts of the Philippines whose
grains are red and whose flavor is different from the white
variety.</p>
<p class="par">Not all the rice grown in the Philippine Islands needs
the extensive irrigation that was described earlier in the chapter;
there is a kind of rice that grows with only a moderate amount of
moisture. It is produced on the steep mountain slopes where irrigation
would be impossible or extremely difficult. <span class=

<p class="par first">&ldquo;Manila hemp,&rdquo; as it is so commonly
called, is not really hemp at all, but a plant closely related to the
banana and so strongly resembling it that some persons are unable to
tell the difference. The correct name for this is abaca
(&auml;&prime;-b&auml;-c&auml;), and it is probably the most important
crop produced in the Philippine Islands. Nowhere else in the world does
it grow so well, and in southern Luzon where Francisco lived, the soil
is especially well suited for its cultivation.</p>

<p class="par">Francisco&rsquo;s father had a good many acres devoted
to it, and his crop yielded him a good income. A field is planted by
setting out, at regular intervals, shoots from old plants. Three years
are required for these shoots to grow to maturity, and a planter must
therefore be willing and able to wait a long time <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25" name="pb25">25</a>]</span>before
he can harvest his crop. An abaca plant grows to a height of ten feet
or more, bearing long fanlike leaves that wave gracefully in the breeze
and shut out the sun&rsquo;s rays so completely that noontime in an
abaca field is like twilight. The stem consists of crisp, juicy, green
leaves rolled tightly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href="#pb26"
name="pb26">26</a>]</span>together around a central stalk. These stems
are often eight or ten inches in diameter, and it is from the tightly
rolled inner leaves that the fiber which constitutes the crop is
secured.</p>

<p class="par">When the proper time comes, the men go out into the
field with their sharp bolos (b&#333;&prime;-l&#333;s&#797;), heavy
knives much like corn knives, and cut off the abaca plants close to the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href="#pb27" name=
"pb27">27</a>]</span>ground. They tear away the leaves and the green
outer part of the stem, which they leave on the ground for fertilizer.
The white inner part comes from the plant in long strips and is drawn
through a machine that presses out the water and pulp, leaving only the
fiber, in long white strands. These are hung up in the sunshine to dry
and bleach, after which they are tied into bundles and hauled in
carabao carts to market. New shoots grow out from the old stalk so that
a plantation constantly renews itself.</p>
<p class="par">The planter usually sells his abaca to a shipper who has
a baling machine and large warehouses in some seaport town, with his
own wharves for loading the freight on steamers bound for Manila or
foreign ports.</p>
<p class="par">During the shipping season these warehouses present
scenes of busy activity. Outside is a large courtyard crowded with
carabao carts piled high with fresh abaca which men are weighing and
sorting as it is unloaded. From within can be heard the rattle and rush
of the baling as men and boys, urged by the shrill <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28" name="pb28">28</a>]</span>commands
of their foreman, run around a circular track turning a great wheel
that puts the pressure upon the bales. Extending from the warehouse to
the vessel is a long line of noisy taos (t&auml;&prime;-&#333;s&#797;),
or workmen, carrying the heavy bales out on the wharf and over the side
of the steamer to be stowed away in the hold.</p>

the lives of the Filipino people the coconut plays. The tall slender
trees without a branch, except the cluster of leaves at the very top,
are the most characteristic feature of the Philippine landscape. These
trees supply timbers for building, thatch for roofs and walls of
houses, hats, fans, household utensils, oil, food, and drink. The trees
are often used as corner posts for houses, thus giving a secure
anchorage against wind-storms and earthquakes, while the roofs and
sides are covered with coconut leaves.</p>

used to make hats, brushes, mats, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35"

<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37" name=

to his feet so that they will be about as far apart as the diameter of
the tree, and with this aid in bracing himself, he climbs easily up the
long straight trunk to the leafy crown where the nuts hang in clusters.
He cuts off and drops to the ground as many nuts as are wanted, and
then slides down the tree. With his bolo he strikes a slice from the
husk of a nut so deftly that a small hole is opened in the shell and
the liquid, cool, sweet, and refreshing, is easily drunk. When the
traveler&rsquo;s thirst is quenched, the nut is split in half, a rude
spoon is made from the husk, and the thin layer of soft white meat is
scooped from the shell and eaten. By boiling the kernel of the ripe nut
an oil is obtained which is used for burning in lamps, for cooking, and
for oiling the hair. When the meat of the coconut is dried it is called
copra (c&#333;&prime;-pr&auml;), and large quantities of this are
shipped to foreign countries, where it is used for making candles and
soap.</p>

Filipino, having a bamboo tube slung from his shoulder in place of a
bucket, climbs the tree to collect this sap. The flowers can be so
tapped for about three months; of course the nuts have to be sacrificed
if tuba is wanted, because the flowers die. It is a common sight in a
coconut grove to see large bamboo poles reaching from the top of one
tree to its nearest neighbor. These are for the use of the one who taps
the flowers, so that instead of climbing each separate tree he can pass
from one to another by this dizzy <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39"

close watch, he makes notches in the trees <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40" name="pb40">40</a>]</span>about
fifteen feet from the ground and inserts pieces of broken glass all
around the trunk; then if any one tries to climb past this barrier, he
is severely injured by the sharp glass and is forced to return to the
ground. Sometimes, instead of glass, large thorny branches are fastened
to the trees for the same purpose. When the owner wishes to get his
crop of nuts, he either carefully removes these obstacles, or he climbs
a near-by tree and crosses over from the top by means of a bamboo pole
as when getting tuba.</p>
<p class="par">Francisco&rsquo;s grandfather, who owned a tienda
(t&iuml;-&#277;n&prime;-d&auml;), or small store, in Camalig, used to
tell him a very interesting story about a coconut. &ldquo;A long, long
time ago,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;many years before my grandfather was
born, there grew a very tall coconut tree, far taller than any you have
ever seen; and the fruit that grew on this tree was so large that you
could not even see round it. One day the largest of these nuts fell
from the top of the tree, but instead of striking the ground, it
remained floating about in the air. The <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb41" href="#pb41" name="pb41">41</a>]</span>fibers changed, and
instead of being brown and coarse, they became soft and green and
slowly grew into grass and flowers and trees. By and by, God put people
on the outside shell of this large nut to use and enjoy the
vegetation.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The milk which was inside changed into a terrible
fire that sometimes burst through cracks in the shell of the nut,
causing what we call volcanoes. Demons and various kinds of evil
spirits began to inhabit this inner fiery region, and they have been
known to come out through the craters of volcanoes to trouble the
people who live near by. The smoke and gases that are so often seen
coming from volcanoes, or from cracks in the ground, are from the
burning bodies of wicked people whom these demons have caught and
carried away. And so, Francisco, if you are wise, you will be a good
boy and do just as your father and mother tell you, or you may be taken
from the outside to the inside of this wonderful coconut.&rdquo;

<p class="par first">You must not think that Filipinos spend all their
time in planting rice, harvesting abaca, or climbing coconut trees. On
the contrary, they are fond of amusements, and they find many ways of
gratifying this very natural desire. There were several boys of about
the same age as Francisco, who lived close by, and they played together
most of their spare time. The American soldiers and teachers had shown
the older boys how to play baseball, and the game had become very
popular. Pablo and Jos&eacute; both played well, the older boy having
developed into an excellent pitcher before he went to Manila to enter
college. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43" name=

to play a real game of baseball, but they found much fun in their
efforts to imitate the older boys. Of course their native tongue, which
in southern Luzon is called &ldquo;Bicol&rdquo;
(Be&#862;e&prime;-c&#333;l), had no words for this foreign game, and so
the English terms had to be taken bodily into their own language and
used as native words. If you had watched these small boys playing, you
would have heard Francisco shout as he struck at the ball and missed
it,&mdash;&ldquo;<span lang="bik">Sarong</span>

<p class="par">Filipinos have a game of ball, quite different from
baseball, that is much enjoyed by young and old. The ball is of woven
rattan, about four inches in diameter and very light. As many as wish
to play form a ring, the ball is thrown into the air, and as it comes
down, some one sends it flying upward again. The game is to keep it
from touching <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44" name=
"pb44">44</a>]</span>the ground, and the players show much skill in
striking it with hands, arms, or feet, from various positions and
without getting very far away from their places in the ring. Old men
often watch the boys awhile and then get into the game themselves,
showing surprising agility and seeming to enjoy fully the brief return
to boyhood.</p>

within this are placed small stones or centavos

cockfighting. The present government has limited the enjoyment of this
sport <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46" name=

so it is a great source of evil in every community. The cockpit is
generally a large roofed enclosure with rude bamboo seats rising in
tiers like circus benches, and with a fenced arena in the center in
which the chickens fight.</p>
<p class="par">A small knife blade, keen and sharp pointed, is fastened
to a leg of each of the birds, and when all is ready they are put into
the arena to fight. The owner of a gamecock trains him carefully,
making him scratch to develop the muscles of his back and legs, and in
other ways preparing him for the ring. The fights are often drawn out
until one of the chickens, weak from loss of blood and from the
exertion, falls over dead. Then the winner crows, if he has any breath
left, the crowds watching the fight cheer loudly, bets are paid, new
ones are made on the next pair of birds, and the excitement continues.
At sunset the people reluctantly leave the ring and return to their
homes, the winners jingling their gains, the losers hoping for better
luck <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="#pb47" name=

showing off their conquering heroes or tenderly carrying home the limp
bodies of their pets to be boiled for hours in the vain hope of making
their hard muscles tender for the table. Much time and money are wasted
on this cruel and rather disgusting sport, and it is to be hoped that
it may decrease from year to year and finally die out entirely.</p>
<p class="par">Each community in the Philippines has its patron saint,
and once a year, usually on the day celebrated by the church in honor
of that saint, occurs the fiesta (f&#301;-&#277;s&prime;-t&auml;), or
feast day, of the town. These holidays are looked forward to with
joyful anticipation, and most elaborate preparations are made for the
entertainment of guests. A great tower or arch, sometimes seventy-five
or a hundred feet high, is built of coconut logs, bamboo, and rattan.
Lanterns of gayly colored paper are hung over this, and at night men
climb laboriously over it, lighting candles in each lantern; the effect
is exceedingly pretty and the lights burn for several hours.

enjoying conversation. At noon, the priest serves an elaborate dinner
to the important men of the town and to the distinguished visitors,
while in the various homes, people are entertaining their friends with
the best their tables afford. After dinner is over and all have rested

instruments are those which are commonly used the world over. The great
Constabulary Band of Manila, conducted by an American negro, Captain W.
H. Loving, ranks among the first musical <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb52" href="#pb52" name="pb52">52</a>]</span>organizations of the
world and has several times made tours in the United States.</p>
<p class="par">Filipinos are very fond of plays. In Manila there is a
large Grand Opera House, and many outlying towns have their teatros
(te&#817;-&auml;&prime;-tr&#333;s), or theaters; but in the smaller
places where this is not possible, plays are given at night in some
public square, without stage, scenery, or costumes. The characters
include kings, queens, knights, servants, and even bears or other
animals, all of whom recite their lines to the great delight of a
circle of onlookers who squat upon the ground holding candles or lamps
in order to see the play. At Christmas time, bands of singers and
dancers go from house to house, entertaining the public and passing the
hat for gifts when the program is finished.</p>
<p class="par">These are a few of the pleasures which Francisco and his
friends enjoyed. It is true that some of their work was very hard and
disagreeable while it lasted, but the climate and soil of the
Philippines are so favorable that even the most industrious
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name=
"pb53">53</a>]</span>people have a great deal of leisure time in which
to enjoy life. Francisco&rsquo;s grandfather had a great fund of
stories, and he loved to collect a crowd of children about him and
entertain them with one tale after another. The following story of
&ldquo;The Three Sisters&rdquo; was a general favorite:</p>
<div class="figure xd21e698width"><img src="images/p068.jpg" alt=""
width="623" height="291"></div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Once there were three sisters who were very
beautiful, and they all lived in the same house. A beggar came one day
asking for rice, and one of the sisters went down the stairs with a
plateful for him. As soon as he received it, he seized the girl, and
putting her into a sack, he carried her off to his home. The next day
he said to her, &lsquo;I must go <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb54"
href="#pb54" name="pb54">54</a>]</span>away for several days and will
leave you all my keys. But you must not unlock room thirteen; all the
others you may go in, but not thirteen.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;So she took the keys and an egg which he gave her
to keep, and prepared to wait for his return. By and by she became
curious, however, and decided to open the forbidden room. As soon as
she pushed back the door, she saw scattered about the floor portions of
the body of a dead man. She was so frightened that she dropped the egg
and the keys, and when she picked them up again the egg of course was
broken and the keys were bloody.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;When the old man returned, he saw the broken egg
and the keys with blood on them. So he locked the girl in the room with
the dead man, and went again to the home of the sisters, begging for
bananas. Just as before, one of the sisters came to grant his request
for food, and he put her into his bag and took her home with him. As
with the first sister, he gave her an egg and the keys, with the same
instructions <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55" name=
"pb55">55</a>]</span>not to enter room thirteen. Of course, the second
sister did as the first had done and also dropped the egg and the
keys.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;She was put into the room as a prisoner, and for
the third time the false beggar went to the house, asking this time for
camotes. The third sister passed through the same experiences as the
others, but she was less easily frightened and did not drop the egg and
keys when she saw the dead man. Instead, she went into the room and saw
her sisters prisoners there. She released them, put them into a large
basket, and taking some gold which she found in the room, completely
covered them. She collected the pieces of the dead body, put them
together, and a handsome man awoke from death. She allowed him to
escape from the room, put the basket containing the gold and her
sisters into another room, closed room thirteen, and awaited the return
of the false beggar.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;When he came and saw that the egg was not broken
and the keys were not bloody, he said, &lsquo;You have obeyed me, and
we will <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href="#pb56" name=
"pb56">56</a>]</span>be married.&rsquo; &lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; she
answered, &lsquo;but first you must carry home for me a basket of gold
for my parents. You must not sit down nor stop to rest till you have
taken this basket to my home. I shall be watching you from my little
window, and if you disobey me, I shall never marry you.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="figure xd21e716width"><img src="images/p071.jpg" alt=""
width="623" height="569"></div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;So he started out. He found the basket
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57" name=
"pb57">57</a>]</span>very heavy, and three times he wished to put it
down and rest, but each time he heard a voice which seemed to come from
the basket, saying, &lsquo;Go on, for I am watching you from my little
window; and if you disobey me, I shall never marry you.&rsquo;
Therefore he went toiling on to the home of the three sisters, and
delivered the basket of gold (and the two girls) to the parents.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;When he returned, the man who had been dead but
had come back to life killed the false beggar, married the third
sister, and they lived happily forever afterward.&rdquo; <span class=

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h2 class="main">FRANCISCO AT SCHOOL</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">It was an important day for Francisco when he
became old enough to go to the American school just as Maria and his
two brothers had done. In the Philippines the hottest season of the
year extends through March, April, May, and June; because of this,
school begins about the tenth of June and closes the latter part of the
following March. So it came about that on a certain sunshiny June
morning Francisco put on his cleanest white trousers and his best pink
sinamay shirt (which, like other boys of his age, he wore outside of
his trousers), and started to school. His first teacher was Gregorio
Nipas (Gr&#277;-g&#333;&prime;-r&#301;&#333;
Ne&#862;e&prime;-p&auml;s), a Filipino boy who had been attending
American schools for six or seven years, and could read, write, and
speak English very well. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href=
"#pb59" name="pb59">59</a>]</span></p>
<div class="figure xd21e734width"><img src="images/p074.jpg" alt=
"Schoolhouse" width="620" height="466">
<p class="figureHead"><span class="sc">Schoolhouse</span></p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">Francisco began his work in what is known as a barrio
(b&#259;r&prime;-r&#301;&#333;) school. A Philippine town includes all
the outlying villages for a distance of several miles around, and each
of these villages is called a barrio. Every barrio has its own little
bamboo schoolhouse where the elementary subjects are taught. As the
boys and girls become farther advanced in their work, they go in to the
central town, where there is a school doing work of a higher
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60" name=
"pb60">60</a>]</span>grade and having several teachers. All the barrio
and town teachers of one district are under the charge of an older and
more experienced supervisor,&mdash;in most cases an American,&mdash;who
directs the work of the schools <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb61"
href="#pb61" name="pb61">61</a>]</span>in his territory and visits the
various barrios regularly. From time to time he meets with the town
officials to discuss the needs of the schools, and as frequently as
possible he calls all his teachers together to consult with them, and
give them instructions regarding their work.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e745width"><img src="images/p075.jpg" alt=
"Philippine School Children" width="623" height="658">
<p class="figureHead"><span class="sc">Philippine School
Children</span></p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">Filipino boys and girls do not buy their own books; the
government furnishes the required texts and the pupils are allowed the
use of them while they are attending school. Each child gives a receipt
for all the books that are issued to him, and when school is over he
returns them to his teacher and the receipt is destroyed. In case he
has lost a book or has badly used it, he is required to pay for it.</p>
<p class="par">When Francisco entered school he knew a few English
words and sentences that he had learned from soldiers and from older
boys who went to school. Such expressions as &ldquo;Good
morning,&rdquo; &ldquo;How are you?&rdquo; and &ldquo;<span class=
"corr" id="xd21e754" title="Source: Good-by">Good-bye</span>,&rdquo;
were familiar to him, but of course he could neither read nor write,
and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62" name=
"pb62">62</a>]</span>there were many children of his age who knew no
English at all.</p>
<p class="par">For the first lesson with these beginners the teacher
called them up to his desk, and holding up a book so that all could see
it, said very distinctly the word &ldquo;book.&rdquo; The children
repeated it after him, and in a few minutes they could call the word as
soon as he held up the book. Then he did the same thing with other
articles such as pen, pencil, and paper, until in a little while they
knew thoroughly several English words.</p>
<p class="par">The next step was to form sentences. The teacher again
held up the book, saying slowly and distinctly, &ldquo;This is a
book&rdquo;; and the children carefully repeated &ldquo;De&#862;es
e&#862;es a book.&rdquo; Filipinos have some trouble in making the
sound of short &ldquo;I&rdquo; and of &ldquo;th&rdquo; in <i>this</i>,
<i>these</i>, and <i>those</i>, usually saying
&ldquo;De&#862;es,&rdquo; &ldquo;De&#862;es&#797;,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;D&#333;s&#797;e.&rdquo; Other articles whose names the children
knew were used in the sentences, &ldquo;This is a pen,&rdquo;
&ldquo;This is a pencil.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="figure xd21e772width"><img src="images/p078.jpg" alt=
"School Orchestra" width="624" height="410">
<p class="figureHead"><span class="sc">School Orchestra</span></p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">After these were learned, their teacher made sentences
such as &ldquo;I give you the book,&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63" name="pb63">63</a>]</span>at the
same time giving it to some child; then, &ldquo;You give the book to
Francisco,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Francisco, give the book to me,&rdquo;
until in a few days the children knew accurately a long list of English
words which they were able to use in simple sentences. These sentences
were written on the blackboard for them to read and copy, and thus they
began to speak, read, and write the English language. They worked at
copying these sentences while the teacher taught the other <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="#pb64" name="pb64">64</a>]</span>classes.
Sometimes they sat and listened while the older children recited, and
in this way they learned new words. English was the only language used
in the schoolroom, and often the boys and girls spoke it among
themselves for practice.</p>
<p class="par">After Francisco had worked several weeks in this way and
could recognize many words as soon as he saw them, he was given a
primary reader,&mdash;an honor of which he was very proud. He asked his
father to show him how to weave a grass cover for his precious book so
that he would not soil it. He made rapid progress, enjoyed his school
life greatly, and in course of time he completed the work of the barrio
school and went to the school in town.</p>
<p class="par">Here he found two new interests which he had not known
in the barrio school. Mrs. Bond, the wife of the American supervising
teacher, had charge of the town school. She was an excellent musician
and taught the pupils many songs. Filipinos love music, learn songs
readily, and sing with great <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href=
"#pb65" name="pb65">65</a>]</span>enthusiasm. The older pupils were
becoming able to read music and sing their different parts correctly,
and Francisco entered into this new subject with all his energy. The
padre (p&auml;&prime;-dr&#257;), or priest, was much interested in the
children&rsquo;s musical training, and he made frequent use of it in
his church services.</p>
<p class="par">The other interest that Francisco found when he entered
the town school was manual training, which was begun in the upper
grades. The boys began making simple things out of bamboo and coconut
wood, such as paper cutters, ladles, dippers, spoons, cups, and ash
trays. Later, however, the work was extended to larger and more useful
articles, such as tables, bookcases, benches, and desks for their own
and barrio schools.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e792width"><img src="images/p081.jpg" alt=
"Provincial Schoolboys" width="622" height="677">
<p class="figureHead"><span class="sc">Provincial Schoolboys</span></p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">Of course music and manual training took only a part of
Francisco&rsquo;s time; he was busy reading in more advanced books, and
studying elementary English grammar, arithmetic, and geography. He was
growing rapidly in body as well as in mind, and was learning some of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href="#pb66" name=
"pb66">66</a>]</span>the simple rules of health that he had been
violating before this time because he knew no better. He was taking
better care of his eyes, was more careful about the kind of water he
drank and about eating overripe <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb67"
href="#pb67" name="pb67">67</a>]</span>bananas. He knew now that it was
better for him to keep the window of his sleeping room open at night
instead of tightly closed as formerly, and he took some money that he
had earned, by carrying a basket of fish to the market, to buy a
mosquito netting for his bed.</p>

<p class="figureHead"><span class="sc">Provincial School</span></p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">At last he completed the course given in the town school
and was ready to enter the provincial school, located in the town of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68" name=
"pb68">68</a>]</span>Albay, several miles south of his home. A province
in the Philippine Islands is similar to a county in the United States,
and each one maintains a high school which any boy or girl living in
the province may attend, after he has completed the work of the lower
grades and has passed satisfactory examinations. Courses are offered in
the history and government of the United States and the Philippine
Islands, in literature, in grammar and composition, in mathematics,
drawing, music, cooking, sewing, manual training, agriculture, and,
when called for, Spanish and other subjects. The high school at Albay
contained a very large assembly hall which was used for study when
pupils were not in classes. We shall leave Francisco studying in this
room, while we find out something of the history and government of
these interesting islands. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href=

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h2 class="main">WHAT FRANCISCO LEARNED OF PHILIPPINE HISTORY AND
GOVERNMENT</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">When Francisco entered the provincial school he
knew something about local government from seeing local officials and
hearing older people discuss matters of politics, but his knowledge did
not extend beyond his own barrio and town. As for the history of the
Philippines, he knew little more than that the islands had been under
the control of Spain and were transferred to the United States. Rizal
(R&iuml;-z&auml;l&prime;) Day, which was celebrated on the thirtieth
day of each December, was greatly enjoyed by him as a holiday, but he
had little idea of the reason for its celebration.</p>
<p class="par">American boys and girls know even less than Francisco
about these new possessions of ours across the Pacific. Hence, we shall
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70" name=
"pb70">70</a>]</span>find it interesting and worth while to follow the
outline of Philippine history and government which Francisco studied in
the provincial school.</p>
<p class="par">It is now about four hundred years since the Spaniards
first discovered the Philippines. An expedition under the command of
Magellan set out from Spain in the year 1519, sailed across the
Atlantic and down the eastern coast of South America, through the
strait at the southern end of the continent, and northwest across the
great Pacific, until it finally arrived at the island of Cebu. Here, on
the seventh of April, 1521, a landing was made, and the country was
claimed for the king of Spain.</p>
<p class="par">The savage customs of the natives whom Magellan found
there are shown in the method they followed when drawing up a treaty of
friendship between themselves and the Spaniards. Cuts were made in the
breasts of Magellan and the native chief, and each one drank some of
the other&rsquo;s blood as a pledge that the agreement should be kept
forever. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href="#pb72" name=
"pb72">72</a>]</span>There were priests in the company, and they
persuaded many of the Filipinos to accept baptism. The chief was given
the new name of &ldquo;King Charles I of Cebu,&rdquo; and he agreed to
rule under the guidance of the king of Spain.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e830width"><img src="images/p086.jpg" alt=
"Death of Magellan" width="522" height="720">
<p class="figureHead"><span class="sc">Death of Magellan</span></p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">This Cebu tribe was at war with the Filipinos living on
the neighboring island of Mactan. Magellan undertook to aid his newly
made allies against their enemies, and was killed in battle on the
twenty-seventh of April, 1521. Thus the Spanish expedition lost its
brave and able leader. Of the five vessels that set out from Spain in
1519, only one, the Victoria, returned three years later, battered and
worn by its long voyage around the world, and carrying only a small
fraction of the company of men who had sailed with the little
fleet.</p>
<p class="par">After Magellan&rsquo;s expedition, several other voyages
were made to the new islands, but there were no attempts at a permanent
settlement until 1564. In that year, King Philip II of Spain sent out a
company under the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73"
name="pb73">73</a>]</span>leadership of Legaspi
(L&#277;-ga&#775;s&prime;-p&#301;), a brave and experienced soldier who
had seen years of service in Mexico, and was well known to the king. It
was he who suggested the name &ldquo;Las Islas Felipinas&rdquo;
(L&auml;s &Iuml;s&prime;-l&auml;s
Fe&#817;-l&#301;-p&iuml;&prime;-n&auml;s) for the islands, in honor of
King Philip, or Felipe (Fe&#817;-l&iuml;&prime;-pe), as the name is in
its Spanish form. Magellan had previously named them the San Lazaro
(Sa&#775;n L&auml;&prime;-za-r&#333;) Islands, but this name was
abandoned.</p>
<p class="par">Legaspi&rsquo;s company made a landing on the island of
Cebu just as Magellan had done, but about seven years later it was
found that the port of Manila offered a better location for the seat of
government; so Legaspi transferred his capital to that place and began
the building of a strong city. Later, great walls of stone were
erected, and a fort was placed at the point where the Pasig
(Pa&#775;&prime;-s&#301;g) River flows into Manila Bay. Meantime,
various expeditions were sent into the interior of Luzon and other
islands to subdue the natives, make treaties with the chiefs, and claim
all the lands for the king of Spain. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<div class="figure xd21e845width"><img src="images/p089.jpg" alt=
"Old Manila Wall" width="619" height="532">
<p class="figureHead"><span class="sc">Old Manila Wall</span></p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">The fortifications which were erected in Manila and at
other important points in the islands were necessary for defense
against invaders, and they witnessed many stirring sieges from the time
they were built until Spain ceded the islands to the United States in
1898. For two hundred and fifty years, the cities and towns of the
Philippines suffered <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75"
name="pb75">75</a>]</span>from the incursions of
pirates,&mdash;Chinese, Japanese, and Moros, the last-named being
Mohammedan Filipinos from the southern islands. Numberless towns were
attacked and plundered by these dreaded pirates who, with their swift
sailing praos (pr&auml;&prime;-&#333;s), or boats, would swoop down
upon a town, kill the men, burn the houses, and carry away the women
and children either to be sold into slavery or held for ransom. The
Spanish government used all the powers at its command to suppress this
piracy, but with only partial success.</p>
<p class="par">During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the
people of the Philippines were greatly troubled by invasions of Dutch
and English fleets, echoes of larger wars in Europe between these
countries and Spain. Commerce was preyed upon, ships were sunk, and
rich stores of precious silks, spices, and gold were seized and carried
off as booty. Such losses were very hard upon the merchants whose
property was stolen, and the taxes, made necessary by the long struggle
with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76" name=
"pb76">76</a>]</span>these enemies, laid a still greater burden upon
the people. For about two years, from 1762 till 1764, the English held
Manila, but when peace was finally declared, the British flag was
hauled down and the islands returned to Spain.</p>
<p class="par">Wars with pirates, and with the Dutch and English, were
not the only causes of distress in the Philippines, however. Numberless
times in the history of the islands crops have been damaged and houses
destroyed by terrific storms and earthquakes, cattle have been carried
off in great numbers by disease, while cholera and smallpox have
claimed thousands of human lives, and leprosy has spread itself
alarmingly.</p>
<p class="par">Until early in the nineteenth century, the island
government was administered from Mexico rather than directly from
Spain, and this often led to dishonesty and bad management of affairs.
Corrupt men got into power and used their offices to enrich themselves.
A system of taxation was followed for many years, by which the
collectors were able to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href=
"#pb77" name="pb77">77</a>]</span>work great injustice upon the
Filipinos. Commerce was so restricted that the islands, instead of
developing their natural wealth, remained poor. A very strict rule
governing the production and sale of tobacco required that a
man&rsquo;s crop be sold only to the government, and at a price which
the government fixed. Schools were few, free speech was suppressed, and
attempts to publish anything in criticism of the evil conditions was
severely punished. A number of Filipinos of great ability and honesty
of purpose, among them the patriot whose memory is kept alive by a
public holiday in his honor,&mdash;Dr. Jos&eacute; Rizal,&mdash;were
executed for conspiring against the government.</p>
<p class="par">Therefore it is not strange that there should have been
a constantly growing spirit of dissatisfaction and rebellion, which
broke out into armed revolution at numerous times during the nineteenth
century. In 1898 the United States and Spain became involved in war,
and when fighting ceased the Philippine Islands were ceded to the
Americans. The <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href="#pb78" name=
"pb78">78</a>]</span>Filipinos were displeased at this, for they
desired their independence, and the insurrection was continued for
several years. However, as the people came to see the real purpose of
the United States government,&mdash;to stamp out disease and crime, to
establish schools over the islands, to develop the natural resources of
the country, and to train the people for the art of
self-government,&mdash;the resistance came gradually to an end, and
conditions are now peaceful throughout practically the whole of the
Philippines.</p>
<p class="par">When military rule could be done away with and a civil
government be established, the United States followed the outlines
already worked out by the Spaniards, with such changes as seemed best,
keeping the three divisions,&mdash;insular or general government,
provincial government, and municipal or town government.</p>

<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">At the head of all is the governor-general, who is
appointed by the President of the United States. He is assisted by a
number of men, Americans and Filipinos, who are <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href="#pb79" name="pb79">79</a>]</span>also
appointed by the President and who together make up what is called the
Philippine commission. The laws for the islands are made by the
Congress of the United States and by this commission acting with an
assembly of representatives elected by the people. A supreme court
holds its sessions in Manila and tries cases brought to it from the
lower courts. There is a special system of money for the Philippines,
the unit of which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80"
name="pb80">80</a>]</span>is called the peso (pe&#817;&prime;-s&#333;),
and is worth half a dollar in American money. The post office system is
separate and distinct from that of the United States; the stamps are
different and will carry only mail which is originally posted in the
Philippine Islands. A custom house is maintained for the collection of
duties upon certain goods brought into the islands from other
countries, and taxes are laid upon liquor, tobacco, and similar
articles.</p>
<p class="par">Each province has a governor and various other officers
to enforce the laws, collect taxes, and do the public work. There is a
court, called the Court of First Instance, for trying violations of the
law. There are also an engineer to keep roads and bridges in repair and
arrange for the erection of public buildings, a division superintendent
of schools who, under the director of education at Manila, has charge
of public education in his province, and other legal, financial, and
military officials.</p>
<p class="par">The presidente, who corresponds to the mayor of a city

is aided by a municipal council, whose members are elected by the
voters of the central town and its barrios. Small cases of law-breaking
are tried before justices of the peace, and order is kept by a
municipal police force.</p>
<p class="par">Such, in brief, is the form of government now in force
in the Philippine Islands. The natives play a very large part in the
administration of public affairs, most of the offices are open to
Filipinos of ability, and peace and good order are apparent everywhere.
Much remains to be done before conditions are exactly as they should
be, but the establishment of free public schools from one end of the
archipelago to the other, the decrease in crime and disorder, the
almost complete prevention of the terrible plagues of cholera and
smallpox, and the removal of all lepers to one island where the disease
cannot be given to others, are important results of the new era in the
Philippine Islands, for which the Filipinos should be grateful to the
United States. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82" name=

<h2 class="main">THE STRENGTH OF NATURE</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Francisco lived in a country where Mother Nature
is very kind to her children, and yet treats them with great severity.
He was close enough to the equator to enjoy tropical sunshine the year
round, with no cold weather and but a few months of long-continued
rains. The soil of the Philippines is so fertile that crops grow with
little cultivation. Food, drink, clothing, and shelter are obtained
readily, and so people&rsquo;s wants are easily satisfied. But, as if
to counterbalance this generosity, Nature is exceedingly harsh with the
Filipinos, and those who live in these islands must remain in almost
constant danger of inconvenience, loss of property, or even death at
her hands.</p>

<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">At various times during the year, especially in the
month of September, a traveler in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb83" href="#pb83" name="pb83">83</a>]</span>Philippine Islands will
notice many of the houses braced with long poles which reach from the
four upper corners out to the ground some distance from the house. This
is to safeguard the house against being blown down by a baguio
(b&auml;&prime;-g&iuml;-&#333;). Baguios are terrific cyclones which
sweep in from the China Sea or the Pacific Ocean, and rage over the
islands for hours and even days, leaving death and destruction in their
track. Houses are demolished, crops ruined, trees felled, and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84" name=
"pb84">84</a>]</span>boats washed up on shore or dashed to pieces on
some of the treacherous coral reefs that fringe the shores of most of
the islands. All vessels that have time either hasten to some sheltered
port or put out into the open sea until the wind abates. The weather
bureau at Manila sends out telegraphic reports whenever a typhoon is
known to be approaching the islands, and thus preparations can be made
for the storm.</p>

</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">Even if the storm is not severe enough to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85" name="pb85">85</a>]</span>blow a
house over, the thatched roof is sometimes lifted so that the rain
pours in, soaking clothing and furniture. While a baguio is in progress
the people often gather in one room of their house and pray for safety,
chanting their prayer in a most mournful wail that rises and falls with
the gusts of wind.</p>
<p class="par">After such a storm has subsided, the sight is a sorry
one; acres of abaca beaten down and washed into heaps of useless
vegetation,&mdash;a most serious loss requiring three years of growth
for the plants to replace themselves; fields that were waving with
beautiful green rice lying flat, ruined for a season; trees broken off
or uprooted; houses roofless or in ruins, and the shores strewn with
drift-wood or wreckage. It is most fortunate that tropical nature is so
lavish with those who live there, else they could not withstand the
loss and devastation that result from the frequent and violent
storms.</p>
<p class="par">People who live in volcanic countries may expect
earthquakes at any time, and such <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb86"
href="#pb86" name="pb86">86</a>]</span>shocks are very common in the
Philippines,&mdash;so common, in fact, as to arouse little comment
unless the shaking is severe. Francisco was awakened many nights by
hearing his bamboo home creak and by feeling the strange swaying
motion, or the sudden jerks, that are so terrifying when one is only
half awake.</p>
<p class="par">Unless the shock is violent there is little danger, even
for those who live in stone houses. In the history of the islands there
have occurred many earthquakes, however, of such strength that whole
cities have been left in ruins. About 1863 Manila and the surrounding
country received a shock that destroyed practically the entire city and
killed thousands of people. In 1880, violent shocks lasted over a
period of ten days, causing untold loss and suffering. In recent years
re-enforced concrete has been taking the place of stone in the building
of bridges, churches, and other large structures, and it has been found
to withstand earthquakes well.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e926width"><img src="images/p102.jpg" alt=
"Mayon Volcano" width="622" height="476">
<p class="figureHead"><span class="sc">Mayon Volcano</span></p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">Closely connected with the earthquakes are the volcanoes
of the islands, which have a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href=
"#pb87" name="pb87">87</a>]</span>long and destructive history,
especially Mount Taal (T&auml;&prime;-&auml;l) near Manila, and Mount
Mayon (M&#563;-&#333;n&prime;) in southern Luzon. The latter volcano
has been in eruption many times; the records show a total of more than
twenty-five eruptions since the year 1616, and it is probable that
previous to the nineteenth century observations were inaccurately made
and many eruptions have gone unrecorded. More than half of the
eruptions have been severe. That <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb88"
href="#pb88" name="pb88">88</a>]</span>of February 1, 1814, was
especially dreadful, burying the country around the mountain under tons
of lava and ashes, and causing about twelve hundred deaths. The parish
priest of one of the towns near by has left the following description
of the event:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Repeated earthquakes took place the night before,
and they continued during the morning of the first. There was then a
stronger shock, and at the same moment a cloud of smoke rose from the
mouth of the volcano. The cloud rose in the form of a pyramid and then
assumed a feathery appearance which was very beautiful. As the sun was
shining, the phenomenon presented various colors. The top was black,
the center took on various colors, while the sides and lower part
appeared of an ashy tint. While we were watching this, we felt a strong
earthquake, which was followed by loud noises and rumblings. The
volcano then continued to vomit forth lava, and the cloud extended till
it darkened the whole district; and then sparks and flashes seemed to
come from the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89" name=
"pb89">89</a>]</span>ground and from the cloud, so that the whole
presented the aspect of a most terrible storm. There followed almost
immediately a rain of large, hot stones which broke, and burnt whatever
they fell upon. A little later, smaller stones, sand, and ashes were
thrown out for more than three hours.... Towns were entirely destroyed
and burnt.... The darkness caused by the eruption was noticeable as far
as Manila, ... and, according to some, the ashes erupted passed as far
as China.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Around the base of Mount Mayon are many geysers and hot
springs which are used for baths as cures for diseases, and as
convenient places in which to scald hogs at butchering times. Gases and
steam arise from cracks in the ground constantly, as if some great
kettle were boiling just beneath the surface of the earth. At times the
mountain smokes, sending up thin, fine wisps that curl lazily into the
air or wind in graceful circles about the crater. Wise men who
understand volcanoes say that it is a good sign when the mountain
smokes, because it means that the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb90"
href="#pb90" name="pb90">90</a>]</span>gases are escaping, and that an
eruption is not so likely to occur as when the crater is closed and the
steam is confined.</p>
<p class="par">There is an interesting story current in various parts
of the Philippine Islands, which advances a new theory to account for
the smoking of volcanoes. It is said that many years ago an old man
lived in the crater of the mountain and ruled all the country round its
base. He permitted the people to use the land part way up the
mountainside, but drew a line beyond which they might not go. He
disappeared for a long time, however, and the people forgot his ruling,
planting tobacco all the way to the summit.</p>
<p class="par">Finally, however, the old man returned, and when he saw
that he had been disobeyed, he was exceedingly angry. He roared out his
curses at the people, shook the mountain, and threw down hot stones and
ashes at them until they fled down into the valley, terrified and
ashamed.</p>
<p class="par">As a further punishment, he took all their crop of
tobacco and told them that until he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb91"
href="#pb91" name="pb91">91</a>]</span>had finished smoking it they
might not make any use of the mountain slopes. Then he retired within
the crater with his immense stock of tobacco, and whenever the mountain
smokes, the older men nod wisely and say he is still smoking the
people&rsquo;s tobacco.</p>

<h2 class="main">FRANCISCO&rsquo;S GRADUATION AND TRIP TO MANILA</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">At last the day came when Francisco had completed
his course in the provincial school and was ready to receive his
certificate of graduation. The term closed on the twenty-seventh of
March, and the principal had arranged for a great &ldquo;fiesta&rdquo;
in honor of the occasion, consisting of music and addresses in the
morning, athletic exercises in the afternoon, and a grand
&ldquo;baile&rdquo; at night.</p>
<p class="par">A temporary stage, erected by the boys of the manual
training classes, was placed at the north end of the plaza, and long
before the appointed hour the square was filled with gayly dressed
women, and men in the whitest of suits, who walked about under the
trees or sat on the green grass to await the commencement exercises.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href="#pb93" name=
"pb93">93</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Promptly at ten o&rsquo;clock the procession issued from
the front door of the schoolhouse, filed into the plaza, and took seats
on the stage. The graduates sat in the center, the chief officials on
their right, and the faculty of the school on their left. The school
orchestra was stationed just in front of the stage, and as they
finished playing &ldquo;America,&rdquo; the padre in his long black
gown stepped forward and offered a short prayer, speaking in Bicol and
Spanish so that his hearers might understand and follow him. Then came
short addresses by the governor of the province, the major commanding
the United States troops stationed at that post, the presidente of the
town, and the division superintendent of schools, after which the
principal presented the graduates with their certificates. Every one
rose and stood while the orchestra played &ldquo;The Star-Spangled
Banner,&rdquo; and Francisco&rsquo;s high school days were at an
end.</p>

<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">During the month of April, he remained at home getting
ready to leave, for in May he was to sail for Manila, visit a month
with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94" name=
"pb94">94</a>]</span>Pablo, and then enter the Philippine Normal
School. He had never been so far away before, and he looked forward
with delightful anticipation to his trip by steamer to the capital city
of the islands. The time for departure came at last, the <span class=
"corr" id="xd21e981" title="Source: good-bys">good-byes</span> were all
said, and Francisco found himself established on board the steam-ship
<i>Venus</i>, ready to sail. At six o&rsquo;clock the last bale of
abaca had been stowed away in the hold, the hatches were closed, the
anchor was lifted, and the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href=
"#pb95" name="pb95">95</a>]</span>voyage began. Francisco watched the
familiar mountains and valleys of Albay province fade into the distance
as the <i>Venus</i> rounded the outer headlands of the bay and made for
the straits of San Bernardino
(B&#7869;r-n&auml;r-d&iuml;&prime;-n&#333;).</p>
<p class="par">The moon shone brightly that night, and he remained on
deck until late, watching the water glow with phosphorescence as the
boat plowed through it, and thinking of the unexplored world that lay
before him. He could still see the huge bulk of Mount Mayon standing
out clear against the sky, and he felt as if it were the only friend
remaining in the midst of so many strange sights and sounds.</p>
<p class="par">It is pleasant to travel on the tranquil inland seas of
the Philippines, where cool breezes temper the heat of the tropical
sun, and where land is always in sight. Flying fish dart out of the
water as the vessel approaches them, skimming along the surface of the
sea like birds, before diving back again into its depths. Shoals of
porpoises appear from time to time and swim along with the boat,
leaping out of the water and playing in apparent <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href="#pb96" name=
"pb96">96</a>]</span>enjoyment of life. Such experiences were new to
Francisco, for he had never been on the sea before, and he enjoyed
every detail of his trip.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e998width"><img src="images/p111.jpg" alt=

<p class="figureHead"><span class="sc">Pasig River at Manila</span></p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">After two days of travel they passed the island of
Corregidor (C&#333;r-re&#817;&prime;-h&iuml;-d&#333;r), which guards
the entrance to the immense bay of Manila. A few hours later they had
covered the remaining thirty miles of their journey and were steaming
slowly past Fort Santiago <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href=
"#pb97" name=
"pb97">97</a>]</span>(Sa&#775;nt-&#301;&auml;&prime;-g&#333;) and up
the Pasig River to a wharf just below the Bridge of Spain, where the
boat was made fast and the passengers went ashore.</p>
<p class="par">Manila is one of the most interesting cities in the
world, not only because it is the meeting place of the Far East and the
Far West, but also because the present and the remote past are to be
found side by side, and such excellent opportunity is offered for the
study of history at first hand. Here may be found stone walls that were
built at the close of the sixteenth century; and within a stone&rsquo;s
throw are structures erected according to the latest methods of working
with steel and concrete. Almost every language known to man may be
heard on the streets and in the shops, and the Filipino, the Japanese,
the Chinese, and the East Indian rub elbows with the American, the
European, and the African as they all move along the crowded narrow
streets.</p>
<p class="par">Francisco found that he must depend upon his knowledge
of the English language in order to make his way in Manila; he knew
very <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98" name=
"pb98">98</a>]</span>little Spanish, and his native tongue, Bicol, was
almost useless. The Filipinos in this part of the islands speak a
language called Tagalog (Ta&#775;-g&#259;l&prime;-o&#775;g), which is
strikingly different from Bicol. For example, if Francisco wanted a
banana he would call for a &ldquo;<span lang="bik">batag</span>&rdquo;
(b&auml;&prime;-t&auml;g), but the Manila Filipinos would probably not
understand him, as their word for banana is &ldquo;<span lang=
"tl">saging</span>&rdquo; (s&auml;&prime;-ging). Due to the widespread
influence of the American schools, one can find English spoken in even
remote parts of the Philippines, and hence in spite of sixty different
native languages, the people now have a common method of speech which
can be understood in all sections of the islands.</p>
<p class="par">Manila is a city of churches. There are scores of them
in all parts of the city, and many of the older ones are worth visiting
for their beauty of decoration, for their interesting bamboo organs, or
for their historical connections. Those of the Jesuits and the
Dominicans (D&#333;-m&#301;n&prime;-&#301;-c&#259;ns) are the most
beautiful, having a great wealth of gold, silver, and marble, many
statues and paintings, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99"
name="pb99">99</a>]</span>and fine wood carvings to adorn altars,
pulpits, and chapels. The oldest church is that of the Augustinians
(Aug-&#365;st-&#301;n&prime;-ians), built in 1599, and the skill of its
builders is shown by the fact that it has escaped the fury of the
numerous earthquakes from which Manila has suffered. Legaspi, the first
of the Spanish governors of the Philippines, is buried back of the
altar of this church.</p>

<p class="par">Manila consists of several distinct districts, each with
its own peculiarities. That part of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb100" href="#pb100" name="pb100">100</a>]</span>the city within the
walls is the oldest part, and is called &ldquo;Intramuros&rdquo;
(In-tr&auml;-mu&prime;-r&#333;s), or the walled city. Here the streets
are narrow and the houses are of the old Spanish style, closely walled,
with barred windows below, the second floor extending a short distance
out over the sidewalk. The oldest churches are to be found within the
walled city, and here also are the great cathedral and the government
offices.</p>
<p class="par">The wall, built about 1590 for defense against invaders,
is very suggestive of the time of knights in armor; the moat that
formerly surrounded the wall has been drained for sanitary reasons, but
the old bridges and gates are still used, and a few Spanish cannon can
be seen still mounted on the battlements. Of course masonry built in
the sixteenth century would offer small resistance to the guns of the
present day, but the fortifications are allowed to remain as
interesting reminders of the times that are gone.</p>
<p class="par">Just outside of the walled city is the Luneta
(Lu-n&#277;&prime;-ta&#775;), a beautiful driveway and park
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href="#pb101" name=
"pb101">101</a>]</span>at the bay&rsquo;s edge, where the people of
Manila walk or drive in the evening. Here they may enjoy the cool
breezes from the sea and listen to the band concerts, which are given
several times each week. The electric cars pass the Luneta, and
excellent drives leading to it from various directions make it easy for
all to enjoy this public park.</p>

soda fountains, Spanish clothiers, English bankers, French restaurants,
and Japanese curio dealers, with a miscellaneous collection of
Filipinos, Chinese, and other races who make a living by trade.</p>
<p class="par">Francisco found much to occupy his time during the month
he had for sightseeing. He visited not only the points of interest in
Manila, but made excursions to near-by places,&mdash;to Fort McKinley,
where the United States troops are quartered, for a railroad trip on
the Manila and Dagupan (Da&#775;-gu&prime;-pa&#775;n) railroad
(Francisco&rsquo;s first railroad experience), and up the Pasig River
by motor boat,&mdash;all of them delightful and interesting to him.</p>
